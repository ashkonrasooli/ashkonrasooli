- 👋 Hi, I’m @ashkonrasooli
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program again. I would like to be able to create a basic "Hello World" program that is cloud based, has an app, and involves calling some external rest APIs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps that will save the world from impacts of climate change
- 📫 You can reach me via my email: ashkonrasooli@gmail.com
